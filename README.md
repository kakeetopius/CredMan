# 🔐 CredMan

CredMan is a lightweight credential manager that can be used to store securely and retrieve user secrets like login credentials and api keys locally. 
It securely stores the secrets using an SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite database.  

---

##  Features
-  Encrypted local credential storage (SQLCipher)
-  Simple command-line interface
-  Cryptographically secure password generator
-  Lightweight, single binary

---

## Installation

```bash
#install dependencies (for building)
sudo apt install meson ninja-build libsqlcipher-dev     # or any preferred package manager.

#clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kakeetopius/credman.git credman
cd credman

#Build
meson setup build && cd build
meson compile

#Optionally install to path
sudo meson install
```

## [!Note]
On first usage cman will create a database (.creds.db) in the home directory and will prompt for a master password to use when 
encrypting the database and must be provided for all subsequent usages for decryption. If the user wants to store the database
at a different location the path must be set in the environment variable $CMAN_DBFILE. ie
```bash
#add to .bashrc,.zshrc etc
export CMAN_DBFILE="/path/to/db/file"

#or run cman
CMAN_DBFILE="/path/to/db/file" cman ls
```
## Sample Usage
```bash

# Add credential with password generated by cman (Prompts for username)
cman add github --type login 

#Add credential with password provided by user (Prompts for username and password)
cman add github --type login --no-auto 

#Add multiple credentials from a file.
cman add creds.txt --batch
#Batch file syntax can be viewed by using
cman add help

#Add an api key (Prompts for key and additional details.)
cman add google-api-key --type api 


# Retrieve all details about a secret.
cman get github
#or
cman get github --type login

#Get particular details about a secret
cman get github --type login --field pass

cman get google-api-key --type api --field key

#Retrieve all api keys
cman ls --type api

#list all login credentials
cman ls --type login

# get help
cman help

```
