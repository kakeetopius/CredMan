On first usage cman will create a database (.creds.db) in the home directory and will prompt for a master password to use when 
encrypting the database and must be provided for all subsequent usages

```bash

# Add credential with password generated by cman (Prompts for username)
./cman add github auto

#Add credential with password provided by user (Prompts for username and password)
./cman add github no-auto 

#Add multiple credentials from a file.
./cman add --batch creds.txt
#Batch file syntax can be viewed by using
./cman add help

# Retrieve credentials
./cman search github

#list all credentials
./cman ls

# get help
./cman help

```
